# Surya-Ui

It's based on [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

1. It has responsive rem value with default of six breakpoints
2. It has helper function and usefull hooks that can help you to create fully responsive websites
3. The useActiveBreakpoints hooks is purposed to allow create different methods for each breakpoints but you also can do more things with that, eg: create different animation
4. It has default GridTemplate Components that grow based on value that you can customize
5. The GridTemplate has 12 breakpoints for small screen and 24 breakpoints for large screen, but you can still allowed to customize it, including the gap and each grid width, by creating themeConfig instances from ThemeConfigs Classes
6. The Width of GridTemplate container can be customize as well

another feature still on developed, as i don't have much time to do that
